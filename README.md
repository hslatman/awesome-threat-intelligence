## Sources

Most of the resources listed below provide lists and/or APIs to obtain (hopefully) up-to-date information with regards to threats.
Some consider these sources as threat intelligence, opinions differ however.
A certain amount of (domain- or business-specific) analysis is necessary to create true threat intelligence.
